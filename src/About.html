            <h2>About Site</h2>
            <p> 
			This site was published using Microsoft Azure, github.com, Mscode for pushing to and from the repository. 
			I made it to show my resume and showcase my skill set. It demonstrates my usage of html, css, and JavaScript. 
			As I do more projects, I will be adding the working examples to the tabs on this page.

			<h2>About Me:</h2>
			<p>At Flexential, my tenure as a Junior Data Science Engineer has been marked by the strategic design and vigilant
			monitoring of ETL processes, a testament to my proficiency in data warehousing and analytics. Our collaborative efforts
			have yielded robust data infrastructure, underpinned by my ITIL certification and a solid grasp of data extraction and analytics.
			We've embraced Agile methodologies to foster an environment where continuous improvement is the norm, facilitating the seamless integration
			of third-party data into SQL data marts.<br /><br />
				My journey in frontend development, coupled with more than a year of focused data science practice, equips me with a unique perspective on
				connecting intricate data systems with intuitive user interfaces. It's through this lens that I approach my work, driven by a commitment to
				excellence and a dedication to enhancing our data solutions. The skills honed during my most recent role have become cornerstones of my professional 
				ethos, enabling me to contribute significantly to our team's success in developing and maintaining critical Pentaho jobs and transformations.
