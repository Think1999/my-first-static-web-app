            <p>
				Have you ever thought about learning to program? Where would you begin? How much would it cost? What would you need to get things moving?<br />
				The Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that’s a great starting point.It’s cheap, capable, and approachable for newbie programmers.<br />
				And we’ve made a FREE version of Minecraft just for it!It comes with a revised feature set and support for multiple programming languages.<br />
				You can start by building structures in the traditional Minecraft way, but once you’ve got to grips with the in-game features,<br />
				there’s opportunity to break open the code and use programming language to manipulate things in the game world. You’ll be learning new skills through Minecraft! Wow!<br />

			As a group we did not have a lot of time to play with the minecraft codeing but did have about a class peroid. I wish this had been around when I was younger it is a cool and exicting way to learn to code.<br />
			one of the ideas behind it was that you were makeing super hero powers for your Player charactor in the game world.
